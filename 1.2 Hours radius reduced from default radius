-- 2. hours of radius reductions with respect to the the default radiuses have we had during the timeframe provided for each delivery area?
-- there are some issues with hours conversion and summing up

-- reduction with respect to default radius. 
-- edge cases- 1. a radius reduced after default.
-- 2. radius expanded after default. Then reduced after expansion. at timestamp 2022-01-15 20:46:37.995 +0100
-- we are considering when radius is reduced irrespective whether it was reduced from default or larger. 
-- Considered time from the moment reduced from default and until regained to default.
